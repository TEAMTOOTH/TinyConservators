# TinyConservators
Tiny Conservators for the MUNCH museum

**Tiny Conservators** is a game made for the Percieve Project as a way to communicate Care, Wonder and the loss of color in Edvart Munch's The Scream("Skrik") 1910(?)

PERCEIVE is a research project aimed at transforming the way in which we study, reproduce, and exhibit coloured artworks, securing their legacy for future generations.
